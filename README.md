# CITS3002-Project

## Aim: Build both wallet and miner software for a bitcoin-esque cryptocurrency.

## Constraints/Requirements:
- Must write two distinct pieces of software (Miner and Wallet).
- Must execute across AT LEAST 3 different computers connected via a network.
- Can be developed for ONLY one Operating System.
- Project may be written in Python, Java, C99 or C++ (or a combination but not required).
- Traffic must be end-end encrypted via SSL.

## Process:
- Research into cryptocurrencies, SSL (in a language - probably Java or Python based on everyone's experiences) and start thinking about how software needs to work together.
- Design how the wallet and miner will interact with one another.
- Start working on which each of these programs (perhaps divide up the work, but not make it a rigid restriction).
- Employ some good ol-fashioned Object Oriented design when writing software for each of the programs (if we split up into two groups, two members should work together to come up with function names and so on which shouldn't be changed)
